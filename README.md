EOS Nation believes that EOS is one of the leading go-to platforms that will revolutionize the blockchain and deliver even more advancements and impact the industry like never before. Consequently, our team is working towards raising awareness and growing the EOS ecosystem through community engagement and education.  

Over the course of the coming weeks and months, EOS Nation will be hosting a variety of casual meetups and conferences across cities in Canada, the United-States, and possibly elsewhere across the world!

We want to disseminate EOS far and wide and are looking to collaborate with various persons and groups to accomplish this goal. As team of 7 ambitious co-founders, EOS Nation can do a lot... Harnessing the power of Ambassadors we can do exponentially more! 

An EOS Nation Ambassador is an individual that is passionate about the EOS project and wants to play a part in the ecosystem by hosting or participating in events to promote the EOS ecosystem. Ambassadors are provided with educational material and the logistical know-how to help organize and run successful events. Subsequently, Ambassadors improve the educational material so that others can benefit from their acquired practical knowledge
